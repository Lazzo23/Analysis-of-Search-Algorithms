# Analysis-of-Search-Algorithms

Conducting and examining **Search Algorithms** within a basic testing environment:  
- *Breadth-First Search Algorithm*
- *Depth-First Search Algorithm*
- *Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search Algorithm*
- *Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm*
- *A Star Search Algorithm*

## Testing Environment
The warehouse has P parking positions, where each position can accommodate N equally sized boxes. The figure below shows a warehouse with P=4 and N=5. The warehouse is managed by a robotic arm, which can only access the top box at each parking position. The robotic arm recognizes the command: "MOVE p,r", which takes the top box at the p-th position (1 ≤ p ≤ P) and places it on top of the stack at the r-th position (1 ≤ r ≤ P). If the r-th position is empty, the box is placed on the ground. If the p-th position is empty, nothing happens.
The operator of the robotic arm is provided with the initial and final configurations of the warehouse, and then seeks the shortest sequence of commands that will rearrange the boxes according to the desired pattern.
